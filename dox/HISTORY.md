| --------- | ----------- |
|  6 MAR 22 | First power up of mounted housekeeping shelf components. |
|  8 MAR 22 | WD Passport USB drives do not work, housekeeping shelf will need a powered USB hub to support USB drive. |
|  9 MAR 22 | Replace SanCloud BeagleBone w/ordinary BeagleBone Black.  Now that a USB powered hub is required, I can use a USB WiFi adapter w/antenna for much better performance.  |

| 24 MAR 22 | Nginx/Gunicorn/Django web server working.  |
